The new SSI3 composite has extensions up to 1600 nm using SORCE SIM
data (and model for gaps) and uses the GSFC SSI2 composite with
adjustments guided by proxy modeling of SORCE and OMI solar irradiance
measurements (OMI for 265-500 nm and SORCE elsewhere).

The updated SSI3 composite has extensions down to 0.5 nm using SORCE
XPS (0-6 nm), SDO EVE (6-33 nm), and TIMED SEE (33-120 nm). It also
has correction for 500-1600 nm range to agree with TSIS-1 SIM
irradiance reference on March 14, 2018.  This correction is less than
1% for 500-900 nm and is as large as 5% for the NIR (900-1600 nm).

The motiviation for these adjustments to GSFC SSI2 is to reduce the
offset levels between the different irradiance measurement sets and to
adjust the UV part of the SSI2 composite to the same level as SORCE
SOLSTICE that has higher radiometric accuracy than past observations.
This approach does remove any long term trends in the SSI2 composite
that is not consistent with the proxy long term trends.  Several
different proxies are used to be representative of different layers of
the solar atmosphere and sources of solar variability.  None of the
proxies showed any significant long-term trend, so any significant
offsets in the SSI composite are assumed to be related to calibration
differences between different instruments and should be corrected.

File Information for SSI3_EXT_0NM_1600NM
----------------------------------------

The IDL save-set file is ssi3_ext_0nm_1600nm.sav and it has the
variable called "ssi3_ext".  The data structure of SSI3_EXT is the
following with units in parenthesis ().  The IDL restore procedure is
used to read this file.  IDL> restore, "ssi3_ext_0nm_1600nm.sav"

The NetCDF file is ssi3_ext_0nm_1600nm.ncdf, and it has the same data
/ structure as the IDL save-set.  The read_netcdf.pro file can be used
to read this file.  IDL> read_netcdf, "ssi3_ext_0nm_1600nm.ncdf",

WAVELENGTH = SSI3 wavelength array from 0.5 nm to 1597.5 nm in 1-nm bins up to 750 nm
				and in 5-nm bins above 750 nm

DATE_YD = Dates for each spectrum in YYYYDOY format:  1978/312 to 2019/325

DATE_JD = Dates for each spectrum in Julian Day format

IRRADIANCE = SSI3 composite spectral irradiance data
				This includes adjustments to the GSFC SSI2 data (115-500 nm) and
				extensions out to 1600 nm using SORCE SIM data.  Proxy models are used to fill gaps.

FLAG_SOURCE = number from -1 to 139 that represents data source that uses definition in GSFC SSI2.
			Modification is that data type "9" is for adjustments / corrections made for SSI3, and
			an offset of 0.5 is made for the data type if 5-day smoothed result is substituted for
			noise spikes (> 3 sigma) in the composite time series.

MODEL = proxy model irradiance time series as based on SORCE or OMI measurements.
			OMI is used for 265-500 nm range and SORCE is used for 115-265 nm and 500-1600 nm ranges.

UNCERTAINTY_IRRADIANCE = relative accuracy (percentage) for the IRRADIANCE values

UNCERTAINTY_MODEL = relative accuracy (percentage) for the MODEL values that is calculated as
					the standard deviation of the difference between the reference data set and model

From GSFC SSI2 composite notes:
The "flag_source" field in each data record contains the source code.
The 10's digit indicates the instrument: 10 (Nimbus-7), 20 (SME), 30 (NOAA-9), 40 (NOAA-11),
50 (UARS-SUSIM), 60 (UARS-SOLSTICE), 70 (NOAA-16 SBUV/2), 80 (Aura OMI), 90 (SORCE SOLSTICE),
100 (Proxy Model).   A -1 means No Data Source.
The 1's digit indicates the data type: 0 (Raw), 1 (Interpolated), 2 (Manipulated),
6 (Mg-II + contrast; observed), 7 (Mg-II + scale; observed).

For SSI3 extension, the new "flag_source" values are 110 for SORCE XPS, 120 for SDO EVE, and
130 TIMED SEE.  Also, the 1's digit value with offset of 0.5 means the data was adjusted for noise from
checking for larger than expected time series differences over a 5-day period.

Proxy Model Notes
-----------------
A two component proxy model is fitted to the irradiance time series at each wavelength using
a variety of different proxies.  The two components include a long-term (LT) component being
the 81-day smoothed proxy and a short-term (ST) component being the daily proxy minus the
81-day smoothed proxy.  The proxies tested in the proxy model fits are:
	Sunspot Number (version 2) - photosphere
	Mg C/W Index (Bremen) - chromosphere
	Lyman-alpha (LASP) - transition region
	F10.7 (Penticon) - corona
	Super Proxy (Woods et al., 2018 MuSIL proxy) - combination of 7 different proxies
	TSI - photosphere

There is also the Visible 2-component model that has a bright faculae
component being the Mg C/W index scaled to the TSI composite variability and a dark sunspot
component being the TSI composite minus the scaled Mg C/W index.

The best proxy is selected based on the largest fit correlation with the following result:
	F10.7 for 0-6 nm
	Lyman-alpha for 6-208 nm
	Mg C/W for 208-290 nm
	Visible 2-component for 290-1600 nm
